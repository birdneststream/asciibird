# Asciibird Code of Conduct

## Be respectful

In a project the size of asciibird, inevitably there will be people with
whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that,
but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor
behaviour or personal attacks, and a community in which people feel
threatened is not a healthy community.

## Assume good faith

asciibird Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goal of a
[free](https://www.debian.org/intro/free) ascii editor which may differ
from your ways. Assume that other people are working towards this goal.

Note that many of our Contributors are not native English speakers or
may have different cultural backgrounds.

## Be collaborative

asciibird is a large and complex project; there is always more to learn
within asciibird. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Similarly,
offers for help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of
improving asciibird.

When you make something for the benefit of the project, be willing to
explain to others how it works, so that they can build on your work to
make it even better.

## Try to be concise

Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of
persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the
conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is
necessary, consider adding a summary.

Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each mail adds
something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the
thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have
already been made.

Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly
large.

## Be open

Most ways of communication used within asciibird allow for public and
private communication. As per paragraph three of the [Debian social
contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract), you should preferably
use public methods of communication for asciibird-related messages, unless
posting something sensitive.

This applies to messages for help or asciibird-related support, too; not
only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer
to your question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made
by people answering your question will be more easily detected and
corrected.

## In case of problems

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may
reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be
in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However,
regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it
should not be abusive or disrespectful. Assume good faith; it is more
likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that
they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.

Serious or persistent offenders will be temporarily or permanently
banned from communicating through asciibird's systems. Complaints should be
made (in private) to the administrators of the asciibird communication
forum in question.

However, they all do contain useful information on how to conduct
oneself on our communication channels.

- Debian has a [diversity statement](https://www.debian.org/intro/diversity)
- The [Debian Community Guidelines](https://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/)
  by Enrico Zini contain some advice on how to communicate effectively.
- The [Debian Mailing list code of
